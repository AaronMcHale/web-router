# Docker Compose file used during test-traefik-docker-proxy tests.
#
# We define two services:
# - `test-traefik-docker-proxy-ping` aka `ping`
# - `test-traefik-docker-proxy-pong` aka `pong`
# Essentially what we're doing in tests is running docker commands on the
# `ping` container which target the `pong` container. Basically playing
# a game of ping pong.
#
# We need these containers to continue running, nginx seems to be our go
# to process when we need a lightweight container that will keep running
# and not exist immediately.
